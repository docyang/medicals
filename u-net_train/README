Goals: 1.Detect the pulmonary nodule from the CT scans.
       2.Diagnose the sick.

Steps: 1.Nodule Detection using U-Net or FCN or Faster-RCNN or SSD.
       2.Lung segmentation using classical ways.
       3.Blob detection after lung segmentation.
       4.False psotive reduction using 3D CNN.
       5.Malignancy prediction for diagnose.

1st: check out the data include *mhd, csv; get the image and mask for training the nodule
            segmentation using U-Net.
2nd: train the U-Net
3rd: using the model to segment the raw data
